PeakSeg: Peak detection via constrained optimal Segmentation

This repos contains the code for the long version of
https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDP-NIPS -- the main differences are
- more discussion of penalty learning framework.
- comparison with mBIC, BIC.
- L1-regularized model and discussion of selected variables.

To make sure to use the same package versions, please install the
=works_with_R= function by copying the code in [[file:works_with.R]] to
your ~/.Rprofile which will load it at the beginning of every R
session.

Then type "make" to run the code. There are two big steps:

1. Download the ChIP-seq benchmark data set from
   http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/chip-seq-chunk-db/

2. Run the https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDP algorithm on each
   profile in the benchmark.

On my computer it took about 1 week (using one 1.6GHz CPU) to run the
PeakSegDP algorithm on all the profiles in the benchmark.
